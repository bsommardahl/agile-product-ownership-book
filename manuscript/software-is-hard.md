# Software is Hard

## Software Project Failures

The national and international failure rates for software projects are difficult to justify. Not because they aren't true, but because it's hard to explain how such horrible failure rates can be allowed to exist year after year. One study shows that as much as 80% of software projects either failed to be delivered or came in almost 200% of the original estimate of cost. With such staggering failure rates, it really puts the pressure on product owners to do whatever they can to ensure that their project doesn't become part of next years statistics. The good thing about these statistics is that there's no mystery as to why failure rates are so high. Well, there might be a mystery as to why the software industry allows things like that to happen. But we do know what causes these failure rates. And we know how to prevent them. 

Software project failure is completely preventable. Experiencing a software project failure in this decade is similar to dying from a Papercut. 

There are so many reasons why software project could fail, which is likely the reason why so many do. 

How do we know or define project failure?

Project failure can be defined as one or a combination of cost overruns, late deliveries, poor quality, and/or developing a product that does not get used.

It's important to understand what goes into those statistics. The obvious ways a project can fail is to never reach the users for whom it was intended. Other forms of failure could be extreme cost overruns, late deliveries that damage the software's value, or poor quality that results in the inability to maintain, extend, or fix later on.

Failure to Benefit

A solution without a problem is not much of a solution at all. It provides no benefit or value. Software that can't realize it's value is useless and a complete waste and should be considered a failure. 

Software realizes it's value by making someone's life better, increasing revenue, automating some process, or providing some benefit. Even the canonical "Fart App" on your mobile device solves a problem, albeit trivial (apparently we needed a laugh).

Too many software products become failures because they are unable to solve even the most trivial problems. There are a few ways to miss the mark, here. For example, perhaps the software product reaches the users as designed, but it doesn't solve the right problem or the software doesn't solve the problem in the right way. Either way, the users reject the product and it becomes a failure. Another example is a product that tries to solve a problem that is a moving target. There's a great danger in the software attempting to solve a problem that is no longer solvable or no longer need solving. Yet another example comes from a development team who fails to properly implement the solution to a perfectly good problem. Software that doesn't do what it should is a failure. 

Failure to Deliver on Time

Failure to Stay on Budget

Software is hard to estimate correctly and almost always misses the estimate mark. But sometimes software development projects are so grossly under estimated that the project spends all of the companies reserves just to finish the project and recuperate what's left of the investment. Projects like this deserve to be called failures because they were so poorly planned an estimated that they spend most of The value that the software might have provided. Projects like this cause the business to switch to recovery mode instead of being able to enjoy the values of the software brings.

Failure to Build a Maintainable Product

Software can be delivered in pristine condition and satisfy all of the requirements and live up to its design. They can solve the problems of the world and make everyone's life's better. But that's just talking about delivery day. What happens to software that, under the hood has low levels of quality, when it's time to fix a bug?





1) long lived technical debt
2) poor project management practices
3) lack of understanding of the final product on the developers part and on the product owners part
4) 
Why do software projects go over budget?
