# Technical debt

You can think of technical debt much like any other type of debt. Many businesses depend on debt to grow or survive. Over time, small loans turn into much larger debt. If loans are paid back quickly, they don't accumulate interest. Sometimes payback is delayed for one reason of another. The longer a debt is allowed to exist, the more interest it accumulates and the more it costs. Left unchecked, debts and their cost can grow out of control and may lead to the debtor's downfall. 

Technical debt is accumulated in much the same way as many small loans. A "technical loan" is any beneficial software development activity that is postponed. For example, developers might take a loan with a feature by hard-coding a value and leaving a "code comment" to future developers to fix it later. Another example of a technical loan is when a developer writes a section of a system without proper tests. Why would a developer postpone such beneficial activities? Well, technical debt, many times, allows developers to meet business demands to deliver software faster. 

The term "technical debt" was first coined in 1992 by Ward Cunningham. He referred to technical debt as something that actually empowers a software development team to release and deliver features more quickly. Ward Cunningham had the product's best interest in mind when coining the term. His definition of technical debt in 1992 was specifically pointed at short term technical debt. However, the software industry has redefined the term and, as a result, technical debt is thought of as a long term problem. Even so, since 1992, our world has been filled with so much "empowering" technical debt that software is neither being delivered early or maintained in a timely manner. 

There are two ways to think about technical debt:

1) Short-term technical debt is a natural occurrence in any software development project. Even well-known software engineering techniques like test-driven development encourage short-lived technical debt (see TDD). With a small, manageable amount of technical debt, software developers have the freedom to create something that "works" and then clean up the technical debt soon thereafter. The idea with short-term technical debt is that it only exists for a few minutes or hours at most. It is simply a tool that is here at the moment and then gone forever. 

2) long-term technical debt is what we usually think of when we hear the term "technical debt". When technical debt is allowed to live beyond the current developers effort, it becomes a part of the software. Instead of being a useful tool to help developers innovate, it converts into something that actually stands in the way of future innovation. Future features can be built on top of the technical debt which further deepens its grasp on the software. 

Technical debt includes but is not limited to stale code comments, out of date documentation, manual integration of deployment processes, hardcoded values, nested structures, conditional structures, temporary hacks, unused code, unused database tables and columns, or anything in design or code that must or should be done in a different way or could stand in the way of future modification or innovation. 



Technical debt is one of those realities of software development that can sneak up on you and bite you when you least expect it. At times, technical debt is something that is necessary.  Technical debt comes from a few sources: Technical that can come from incomplete requirements. Or simply requirements that weren't completely described to the team and the team so I'm helping to themselves in a corner. Technical that can also come from the team as they're developing the product. Software can become so complex over time that, even small decisions that need correction can build and accumulate into large scale technical debt.

Technical debt exists in many forms. Technical that can be for documentation, unfinished pieces of code, hard-coded values, code that isn't covered by unit tests, unit tests themselves that are poorly designed and needed a lot of maintenance, bugs that have been built on top of making them an inseparable part of the software.

## When is technical debt acceptable?

Not only is technical that sometimes acceptable, but many times it is necessary. there are plenty of examples of software projects that have tight deadlines and need to meet certain goals before a trade show or a certain important date. Still other software projects are focused on beating the competition to market. in these examples, feature set is not really negotiable. Scope is set based on market research and usability studies. That date is in movable and everything absolutely must come off without a hitch that day. 

The canonical example is Twitter.com. The software behind Twitter.com was thrown together as fast as possible in order to get to market at the right time. And when Twitter made it to users desktops around the world it was an instant success. Millions begin microblogging and, as a result Twitter has become a marker in our culture, not just in the United States where Twitter started, but also around the world. What no one realized, was that Twitter was built on top of a mountain of technical debt. And it worked. It helped Twitter to become a major player in worldwide software. 

> Technical debt is only acceptable when the product depends on it to succeed. 

For example,

1) time constraints are so stringent that you believe your product will not survive if the deadline is not met. 

2) 

## What are the consequences of technical debt?

If the benefits of short-term technical debt are Innovation and speed, the consequences of long-term technical debt the exact opposite. Most software development teams and even individual software Developers are able to leap out of the gate at full sprint and make great progress at the beginning of a software project. For projects that have managed to maintain low amounts of technical debt over months of development, Speed, Innovation, stakeholder confidence and team engagement remain high. But, teams who have not managed to fight back technical debt over the Long Haul Find themselves in an impossible situation.

### Speed

Technical debt Usually results in slower development speeds. Many times people compare technical debt too much. As you can imagine, walking in mud is much slower than walking on a firm surface. Your feet get stuck, sometimes you lose a shoe, you're concerned with getting your pants dirty, and you end up having to clean off later on. On the other hand, you're able to walk, run, skip, flip or jump on a solid surface and do all of those things at top speeds. You can go as fast as you want. Development speed of the beginning of a project is very much like walking on a solid surface. It feels great. Everything seems very easy. Working on a project with heavy technical death is very much like walking in mud. Everything seems very slow and difficult. You don't feel very good after you've done it. 

### Innovation

Writing software is a creative process. Consider an artist painting a tapestry. The painter has paint brushes, various colors and a clean canvas with which she can realize the image in her mind. Artists innovate as they create. They depend on quick feedback loops and responsiveness of their tools and their medium in order to maintain the flow of innovation. Any break down in the process threatens possible failure of the tapestry as a whole. Getting slowed down by mistakes (technical debt) that have accumulated over time is something that can rob a project of its innovative potential. Software that can no longer flex, bend and respond to innovation quickly is software that is Marked for Death. 

### Stakeholder Confidence

Software projects exist because stakeholders want them to exist. As long as they have confidence in the team and development process, the development team has breathing room and freedom which is beneficial to productivity. When technical debt slows down improvements, fixes, and innovation, stakeholders inevitably (and rightfully) lose confidence in the development team. Micromanagement ensues and freedom is replaced with slavery. 
You should never underestimate the power of stakeholder confidence. 

If you or your stakeholders feel confident in the development team, the team will have the breathing room they need to 


### Team Engagement

An engaged development team one understands and believes in the vision of the product they are building. Engagement drives better questions which lead to greater ownership and buy-in. An engaged team is more productive and produces a higher quality product. As technical debt builds, the software project becomes less and less enjoyable to work with. Developers find friction at every corner. Team leads become frustrated with missed deadlines. Pressure increases and, as a result, the team becomes less engaged. 

## What motivates technical debt?

As destructive as technical debt can be, it's not actually introduced by malicious people. In fact, technical debt is almost always the result of a desire to ensure team or product success. Technical debt can be caused by any one of the following:

1) rush to market
2) internal team deadlines
3) demos
4) changes to requirements 

## How can I recognize technical debt?

Unfortunately, technical debt is usually recognizable only by its affect on team velocity after the fact. A team that was once nimble and agile, will slow down drastically over time as more and more technical that is introduced. 

There are some ways that you and the team can recognize technical debt ahead of time. As long as the team agrees that lack of test coverage represents technical debt, then it is possible that you could study could cover his reports and that will show areas of your code that have technical debt. You can also run tools over your code to analyze code as it's being built. Again, your team needs to agree that lower scores means technical debt. If they can agree on that, then these analytics tools can easily be used to identify parts of your code that have higher technical debt levels. 

Another way to recognize technical debt, he is to track the amount of time you spend on fixing bugs in certain features. If a certain feature is costing you a lot of time in bug fixes, then you can assume that that Peacher has a lot of technical debt. 
## Who typically decides went to incur technical debt?

Intentional technical debt comes as a result of a conscious decision by the business I order to deliver faster. 

Any other technical debt is not technically decided. Instead, it's something that happens through a series of accidents, oversights and misunderstandings. 

On the other hand unintentional technical debt is "decided" by everyone on the team. 
Everyone shares the blame for technical debt. Many times technical debt is incurred because of a conscious decision to go as fast as possible. Other technical debt is incurred because of requirements that were not fully understood before they were implemented. It would be easy to blame software developers, but the evidence shows that most technical debt comes from the requirements, design and architecture phase, before even the  first line of code is written. 

## Should technical debt be expected and tolerated?

Technical debt that is short term in nature should be expected during software development. Technical debt that is short-lived actually enables developers to innovate and solve tough problems faster. However technical death that is allowed to exist for longer than a few hours becomes long term technical debt. Because of the potential cost of that long-term technical debt, The business needs to make a conscious decision of whether or not it can be tolerated. Outside of those parameters, long-term technical that should never be expected or tolerated. Some believe that technical debt is an inevitable truth of software development. Unfortunately, when people say technical debt is in inevitable, they are usually speaking about long-term technical debt. But the real truth is, long-term technical debt is avoidable and, therefore, should not be expected or tolerated. 

## How does technical debt affect overall software quality?

Software quality is most commonly measured by its ability to live up to expectations on delivery day. But quality should also measured by the software’s ability to accept changes after delivery day. While software may do what it was designed to do, it may be all but impossible to extend an upgrade and fix later on. This difficulty is often caused by technical death that has accumulated over time. Therefore software that is difficult to extend after delivery day should be considered low quality. 

## How does technical debt affect the bottom line?

For some projects, technical debt is actually something that can help the product succeed. However any technical debt that is allowed to live for longer than a few hours become something that will affect the project long-term. Even though a product has become successful by making it to Market early, it's likely that the product will need to be Rewritten or will involve major overhaul at some point. Technical debt always cost more then clean code. This affects total cost of ownership, and in some cases,  can cause the death of a product because of lack of ability to extend and flex with new requirements. The bottom line is, long-term technical debt always affects your bottom line.
